5 - User notes (known deviations)
---------------------------------

* If you change the USB port where the reader is connected, the system
  may ask to provide source disk again! This happens only if the first
  installation was done from a removal device like floppy disk or CD.
  To resolve this issue, just copy the file on your local disk.

* After a successful uninstall, if you plug again the device, the system
  keeps traces of previous installation.
  If you want to remove this behavior, you have to search in 
  "%WINDIR%\inf" directory the files that begin with oemXX.inf and 
  oemXX.pnf.
  Look for "Dell Smart Card Reader Keyboard" in one of those oemXX.inf.
  Then remove this file and the corresponding compiled oemxx.pnf.

6. Troubleshooting
-------------------

If the previously described procedure didn't succeed in installing or
updating the driver, please

1- To be usable, this installation requires that the Microsoft Smart Card
Manager is started.

Note: All Microsoft Smart Card Manager components are already
installed with Windows XP.
DO NOT INSTALL THE SCBASE.EXE OR SMCLIB.EXE COMPONENTS even though
they might be part of this distribution.

To check the status of the Microsoft Smart Card Manager:
   * Right-Click on "My Computer" icon on the desktop,
   * Choose "Manage" and double-click on "Services and Applications"
   * Click on "Services".
   * Then, Double ckick on the "Smart Card" service listed on the right
     part of the Windows.
   * The service status should be "Started" and the StartUp Type should
     be "Automatic" 

If this is not the case,
   * Choose "Automatic" in the "Startup Type" drop-down list, then
   * Click on <Apply> button to start the service.

You can now close the Computer Management Console.

2- If the previously described procedure didn't succeed, please
   Open the Device Manager, 
   Double-click on the "Smart card readers" group and
   Check the state of the "Dell Smart Card Reader Keyboard".
   If a cross appears, or a Yellow bang "!", select the reader, 
   Click on property in the menu and 
   Check the box line "Disable in this material profile".
   Then contact the support.
